<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployment in VMWare Workstation</h1>
This project outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory on a virtual machine running Windows Server 2022. Once this virtual machine is promoted to a domain controller, I join a Windows 10 client to the domain, and create 1,000 user accounts using a PowerShell script.<br />

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

- VMWare Workstation (Virtual Machines)
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell ISE

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 Pro

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Create 2 virtual machines, one running Windows Server 2022 (named "DC-1", a.k.a the domain controller), and the other running Windows 10 Pro (named "Client-1")
-   Assign DC-1 a static IP address
-   Open Client-1's command prompt and perpetually ping (ping -t) DC-1's private IP address. Open Windows Defender Firewall on DC-1 and enable ICMPv4 Echo Request. Go back to Client-1's command prompt and observe the change
-   Install Active Directory Domain Services on DC-1 and promote it to a domain controller
-  Create an admin account and organizational units (OU) in Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC), then login to DC-1 with the new admin account
-  Set Client-1's default DNS server to DC-1's private IP address, then join Client-1 to DC-1's domain
-  Create 1,000 user accounts using a PowerShell script (run PowerShell ISE as administrator)
-  Sign in to Client-1 using one of the newly-created user accounts

I began by creating a virtual machine running Windows Server 2022 in VMWare Workstation. This machine will serve as the Active Directory domain controller in this lab. I'll be referring to this VM as "DC-1".

<p>
Next, I created a virtual machine running Windows 10 Pro. This VM will be used to join the Active Directory domain created on DC-1. I will refer to this VM as "Client-1".
